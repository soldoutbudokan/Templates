Claude code to-do:

PlainCricket
- Fix the "Need 38 off 36b" issue -> i don't like the "b" when we're talking about what the chasing team needs
- Text is not "selectable" - i.e. you cant copy paste
- It loads kinda slow

Other
- ~~Re-write my git history because commits are not showing up in my github stats.~~ **DONE** - Added `soldoutbudokan@protonmail.com` to GitHub account (verified). Updated local git config to use no-reply address for future commits.

FrenchWhisper

OrwellBot
