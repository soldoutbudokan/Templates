Claude code to-do:

PlainCricket
- Fix the "Need 38 off 36b" issue -> i don't like the "b" when we're talking about what the chasing team needs
- Text is not "selectable" - i.e. you cant copy paste
- It loads kinda slow

Other
- Re-write my git history because commits are not showing up in my github stats. FWIW my no-reply git address is 68517314+soldoutbudokan@users.noreply.github.com. Not sure about which one you actually need.

FrenchWhisper
- Need to deploy this to Vercel

OrwellBot
- Possible to make this into a website?
