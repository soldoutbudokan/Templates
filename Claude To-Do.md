Claude code to-do:

PlainCricket
- ~~Fix the "Need 38 off 36b" issue -> i don't like the "b" when we're talking about what the chasing team needs~~ **DONE** - Added regex to strip "b" suffix from ball counts
- ~~Text is not "selectable" - i.e. you cant copy paste~~ **DONE** - Added explicit `user-select: text` CSS
- ~~It loads kinda slow~~ **DONE** - Added 60s in-memory cache + reduced parallel workers (note: cache has limited effect on Vercel serverless)

Other
- ~~Re-write my git history because commits are not showing up in my github stats.~~ **DONE** - Added `soldoutbudokan@protonmail.com` to GitHub account (verified). Updated local git config to use no-reply address for future commits.

FrenchWhisper
- ~~Need to deploy this to Vercel~~ **DONE** - Already deployed at frenchwhisper.vercel.app

OrwellBot

- Possible to make this into a website?

Recipes
- ~~Estimate calories and macros per serving based on the recipe~~ **DONE** - Added nutrition tables to all 12 recipe files with estimated calories, protein, carbs, and fat per serving
