# Marry Me Chicken Soup (Rotisserie Chicken & Gnocchi)

**Serves 6**

## Ingredients

- Half a rotisserie chicken, shredded (about 1.5-2 cups)
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1 small can tomato paste (5.5 oz)
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
- 1 Tbsp chopped calabrian chilis or 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 700g gnocchi
- 1 jar (8 oz) sundried tomatoes, julienned, oil drained but reserved
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 3 Tbsp heavy cream
- 5 oz cream cheese, softened and cubed
- Several big handfuls of spinach
- Salt and pepper
- Parmesan for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat a drizzle of the reserved sundried tomato oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the onion and cook 5-7 minutes until soft and translucent.

2. Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, smoked paprika, and thyme. Stir for 30-60 seconds until fragrant.

3. Add the tomato paste. Cook 2-3 minutes, stirring often, until it darkens to a brick red. Pour in the wine (if using) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.

4. Add the chilis, sundried tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.

5. Simmer for 5 minutes, then add the gnocchi. Cook 3-4 minutes until the gnocchi float and turn tender.

6. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the heavy cream and cream cheese until smooth. Add the spinach and shredded rotisserie chicken. Stir until the spinach wilts and the chicken warms through, about 2 minutes.

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with a heavy hand of Parmesan.

## Notes

- **Gnocchi:** Cooks in 3-4 minutes. Add it later and watch the pot. Overcooked gnocchi turns to mush.
- **Leftovers:** Good for 3-4 days refrigerated. The gnocchi will soften as it sits.
- **Richer broth:** Toss the rotisserie bones into the simmering broth while you wait, then fish them out before adding cream.
