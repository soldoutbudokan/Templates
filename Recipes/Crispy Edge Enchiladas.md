# Crispy Edge Ground Beef Enchiladas

You can swap out the ground beef with any meat you prefer—chicken, turkey, pork, or even a plant-based alternative.

**Servings:** 6 (14 enchiladas)

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 tsp taco seasoning
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- Red pepper flakes to taste
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Assembly

- 14 flour tortillas (8-inch)
- 2 cans enchilada sauce (600 ml total)
- 3 cups shredded cheese

### For Serving

- Sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.

2. Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain excess fat.

3. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3–4 minutes.

4. Stir in taco seasoning, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

5. Grease a 9x13 pan and spread some sauce on the bottom.

6. Fill tortillas, roll seam-side down, top with remaining sauce and cheese (letting it hit the pan edges).

7. Bake uncovered 20–25 minutes. Broil 1–2 minutes for extra crispiness.

8. Serve with sour cream on the side.
