**Cook Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Servings:** 3-4

## Ingredients

### For 300g Paneer

- 300g paneer, crumbled
- 2 medium onions (about 200g), finely chopped
- 3 medium tomatoes (about 250g), finely chopped
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt to taste
- 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves
- 1/2 lemon for juice

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

2. Add finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.

3. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute.

4. Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook until tomatoes are soft.

5. Crumble fresh paneer with your hands and add it to the pan. Mix well and cook for 3-4 minutes. The paneer should be well combined with the spices but still remain soft and moist.

- Fresh homemade paneer works best, but store-bought is fine too.
