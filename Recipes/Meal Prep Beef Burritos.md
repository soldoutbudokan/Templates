## Ingredients

### Protein and Vegetables

- 1 lb lean ground beef (90/10 or 93/7)
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 large bell pepper, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (16 oz) refried beans

### Seasonings

- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp cayenne (optional)

### Assembly

- 4-5 large flour tortillas (10-12 inch)
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese
- 1/4 cup salsa (optional - reduce if concerned about excess moisture)
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### Optional Toppings

- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime juice
- Sour cream (add when serving, not during assembly)

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

2. Add onion and bell pepper, sauté 4-5 minutes until softened.

3. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. Add ground beef, break apart with spoon, cook 6-8 minutes until browned.

5. Stir in all seasonings.

6. Add refried beans and salsa (if using), mix well and cook 3-4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Let cool 5-10 minutes and drain any excess liquid.

7. Warm tortillas 20-30 seconds in microwave.

8. Place 3/4 cup filling down center of each tortilla. Top with cheese and cilantro. Fold in sides, then roll tightly from bottom to top.

9. Let burritos cool completely. Wrap each individually in foil or plastic wrap. Refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze up to 3 months.

## Reheating

**From Fridge:** Unwrap completely, place on plate (no cover), microwave 1-2 minutes, flip halfway.

**From Freezer:** Unwrap completely, place on plate (no cover), microwave 2-3 minutes, flip halfway.

## Tips

- Don't reheat in closed containers - causes soggy exterior.
- Drain excess liquid from filling before assembling.
- Let filling cool before wrapping to prevent moisture buildup.
- Don't overfill or they won't seal properly.
- Lean beef renders less fat, so draining is usually optional.
