A classic Italian-American dish featuring a creamy tomato sauce with a hint of vodka that enhances the flavors.

**Total Time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Prep Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 20-25 minutes  
**Servings:** 4-6

## Ingredients

- 1 pound pasta (penne works well)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 3-4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 cup vodka
- 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh basil leaves, torn (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

3. Add garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for another 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. Add vodka and simmer for 2-3 minutes to cook off the alcohol.

5. Stir in crushed tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

6. Reduce heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer gently for another 3-4 minutes.

7. Add the drained pasta to the sauce along with the grated Parmesan. Toss well to coat, adding a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.

8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

9. Serve immediately, garnished with torn basil leaves and additional Parmesan cheese.

## Tips

- The vodka helps release flavors from the tomatoes that are alcohol-soluble, creating a more complex sauce
- Reserve pasta water - the starchy water helps the sauce cling to the pasta
- For a lighter version, you can use half-and-half instead of heavy cream
- This dish pairs wonderfully with a crisp salad and garlic bread
