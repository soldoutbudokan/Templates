# Hearty Beef Chili (Light on Beans)

A meat-forward chili recipe with minimal beans - perfect for those who prefer more meat than beans!

**Servings:** 8-10  
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 45 minutes - 2 hours

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs ground beef (or cubed beef chuck)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 can (15 oz) kidney or pinto beans, drained
- 3 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: diced jalapeño, cayenne, or hot sauce for heat

## Instructions

1. Brown the beef in a large pot over medium-high heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain excess fat if needed.

2. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic, cooking until softened (about 5 minutes).

3. Stir in all the spices and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and beef broth.

5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for at least 45 minutes (longer is better - up to 2 hours for deeper flavor).

6. Add the beans in the last 15 minutes of cooking (or earlier if you prefer softer beans).

7. Taste and adjust seasonings.

## Tips

- **Sweetness:** Add 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup to balance acidity and add depth
- **Beans optional:** You can skip beans entirely or substitute with vegetables like diced zucchini or mushrooms
- **Leftovers:** Chili freezes beautifully - store in airtight containers for up to 3 months
- **Longer cooking:** The longer it simmers, the better the flavor develops

## Serving Suggestions

- Topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions
- With cornbread, tortilla chips, or over rice
- In a bread bowl for a hearty presentation

Enjoy!
