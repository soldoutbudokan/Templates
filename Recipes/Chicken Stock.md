# Simple Rotisserie Chicken Stock

## Ingredients

- Bones and carcass from your rotisserie chicken
- 1 onion, quartered (skin on is fine)
- 2 carrots, rough chopped
- 2 celery stalks, rough chopped
- A few garlic cloves, smashed
- A handful of peppercorns
- A bay leaf or two
- Cold water to cover (about 8-10 cups)
- 1 bouillon cube (optional)

## Instructions

1. Throw the bones into a large pot. Add the vegetables, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Cover with cold water by an inch or two.

2. Bring to a boil over high heat. The moment it boils, drop to a low simmer. You want lazy bubbles, not a rolling boil. Boiling makes cloudy, greasy stock.

3. Simmer uncovered for 1.5 to 4 hours. Skim any grey foam that rises in the first 20 minutes. After that, leave it alone.

4. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Press the solids to squeeze out the liquid, then discard them.

5. Season with salt. Taste it. If it seems thin or weak, add half a bouillon cube, stir until dissolved, and taste again.

## On Bouillon Cubes

Yes, you can use them. No shame in it. Rotisserie bones make decent stock, but they've already given up some of their goodness during roasting. A bouillon cube fills the gap. Add it at the end so you control the salt. Start with half, taste, then add more if needed.

## Storage

- **Fridge:** 5 days
- **Freezer:** 3-4 months

Let it cool, then refrigerate. The fat will rise and solidify on top. Scrape it off or leave it as a seal.
