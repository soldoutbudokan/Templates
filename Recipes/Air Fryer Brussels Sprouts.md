# Air Fryer Brussels Sprouts

## Ingredients

- 1–1.5 lbs Brussels sprouts
- 1–2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 2–3 tablespoons grated Parmesan

## Instructions

1. **Prep the sprouts:** Trim the stem ends (optional) and halve larger sprouts. Small sprouts can stay whole. Remove any loose or yellowed outer leaves.

2. **Season:** Toss the sprouts in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning until evenly coated.

3. **Arrange in air fryer:** Place sprouts in a single layer in the air fryer basket, cut side down. Don't overcrowd—cook in batches if needed.

4. **Cook:** Air fry at **190–200°C (375–400°F)** for **15–20 minutes**, shaking the basket halfway through.

5. **Finish:** Remove from air fryer and immediately toss with Parmesan while still hot.

## Tips

- Make sure sprouts are completely dry before tossing with oil for maximum crispiness.
- No liner needed—direct contact with the basket gives the best results.
- The sprouts are done when outer leaves are dark and crispy and you can pierce the center easily with a fork.
- For crispy Parmesan, add it in the last 1–2 minutes of cooking (watch closely to avoid burning).

## Optional Variations

- Balsamic glaze drizzled at the end
- Honey and sriracha
- Crispy bacon bits with a squeeze of lemon
