# Air Fryer Brussels Sprouts

## Ingredients

- 1–1.5 lbs Brussels sprouts
- 1–2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 2–3 tablespoons grated Parmesan

## Instructions

1. Trim the stem ends (optional) and halve larger sprouts. Small sprouts can stay whole. Remove any loose or yellowed outer leaves.

2. Toss the sprouts in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning until evenly coated.

3. Place sprouts in a single layer in the air fryer basket, cut side down. Don't overcrowd—cook in batches if needed.

4. Air fry at 190–200°C (375–400°F) for 15–20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.

5. Remove from air fryer and immediately toss with Parmesan while still hot.

## Tips

- Make sure sprouts are completely dry before tossing with oil for maximum crispiness.
- No liner needed—direct contact with the basket gives the best results.
- The sprouts are done when outer leaves are dark and crispy and you can pierce the center easily with a fork.
- For crispy Parmesan, add it in the last 1–2 minutes of cooking (watch closely to avoid burning).
- **Variations:** Balsamic glaze drizzled at the end, honey and sriracha, or crispy bacon bits with a squeeze of lemon.
