# Japanese Curry with Paneer - Adjusted Recipe

## Ingredients:

- 4 Japanese curry roux blocks (we have been using the brand S&B for the most part - I would start with the "medium" spicy version, but none of them are particularly spicy)
- 1 block of paneer (roughly 300-350g), cubed into 1-inch pieces (can replace this with just about any kind of meat)
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed, also into 1 inch pieces (or smaller if you want the cooking process to go quicker)
- 1.5 large onions (or 2-3 medium onions), diced (it will look like a lot, but they reduce down quite a bit)
- 4-6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated (completely optional, I don't typically add this)
- 1 carton of vegetable broth (900 ml) (can substitute with chicken stock, and in a pinch even water will work)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan)
- 1-2 tablespoons maple syrup (optional, but recommended)
- 1 tablespoon garam masala (optional)
- Salt to taste
- Steamed rice for serving (or Naan)

## Instructions:

1. Coat the bottom of a pan in oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onions until they just start to brown, stirring occasionally. Then add the minced garlic (and ginger if you have chosen to add).

2. Add the paneer cubes and fry until golden brown on all sides (about 2-3 minutes). Remove and set aside.

3. In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed. Add both diced onions and sauté until translucent and slightly caramelized (about 7-8 minutes).

4. Add potatoes to the pot and stir for 2-3 minutes. (Here you can also add any kind of vegetable you might add in a stew, for example carrots, sweet potatoes, peas, etc)

5. Pour in broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are almost tender (about 15 minutes).

6. Break the 4 Japanese curry blocks into pieces and add them to the pot while simmering. Stir until completely dissolved.

7. If using, add the honey or maple syrup now for added sweetness.

8. If using garam masala, stir it in at the end.

9. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

10. Serve hot over steamed rice or with naan.
