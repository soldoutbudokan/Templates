# French Bread Pizza
## Overview

## Why It Works

- Using grocery store-style soft French bread ensures tender, crisp texture
- Pre-toasting with garlic butter/oil creates a base that won't get soggy
- Compressing bread with a baking sheet prevents curling
- Double layers of cheese (first layer baked before sauce) prevent sogginess

## Ingredients

### Garlic Butter Base
- 3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter (optional)
- 4 tablespoons (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1-4 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)
- 1/4 cup (15g) minced fresh parsley or basil leaves (or mix) (optional)
- Kosher salt (optional)

### Pizza
- 1 large loaf French or Italian bread (~18 inches long, 4 inches wide), split lengthwise and crosswise
- Pizza Sauce
- 8 ounces (225g) freshly grated whole milk mozzarella cheese (or your favourite pizza cheese)
- 2 ounces (60g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (Optional)
- Any other toppings you might put on French Bread Pizza

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 425°F (220°C) with rack in upper position.

2. **Make garlic butter:** Heat butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic, pepper flakes, and oregano. Cook until garlic is softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in half the parsley/basil and a pinch of salt. Remove from heat.

3. **Prepare bread:** Place bread cut-side up on work surface. Using a rimmed baking sheet, press down evenly until compressed to about 2/3 original height. Place bread on baking sheet. Brush half the garlic butter mixture over cut surfaces.

4. **First bake:** Spread 1/4 of the mozzarella over bread surface. Bake until cheese is barely melted. Remove and set aside.

5. **Final assembly:** Spread sauce evenly over bread, then top with remaining mozzarella (and any other toppings). Bake until cheese is melted and starting to brown.

6. **Finish:** Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano, remaining parsley/basil, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cool slightly and serve.

## Notes

- Use soft grocery store "French" or "Italian" bread, not a crusty baguette. It should have a crisp exterior, but when you squeeze the bread, it should give.
- The double cheese layer technique is key to preventing soggy bread
- Fresh herbs added at the end keep flavors bright
