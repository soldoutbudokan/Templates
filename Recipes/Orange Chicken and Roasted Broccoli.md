# Orange Chicken and Broccoli (Meal Prep Friendly)

**Serves: 5** | **Prep Time: 15 min** | **Cook Time: 30 min**

This recipe is optimized for reheating and uses pan-frying instead of deep frying. The chicken thighs stay moist and tender, and the sauce reheats beautifully.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs (better for reheating than breasts)
- 4 tablespoons cornstarch (adjust to preference)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper

### For the Orange Sauce
- 3/4 cup fresh orange juice (about 2-3 oranges)
- Zest of 1 orange
- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar

- 1-2 tablespoons oil (regular or sesame oil)

  - Simple: 1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp onion powder

## Instructions

### Prep the Chicken
1. Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces
2. Toss with 3 tablespoons cornstarch, salt, and pepper until evenly coated

### Cook the Chicken
1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Working in batches if needed, pan-fry the chicken pieces for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through
3. Set aside on a plate

### Make the Orange Sauce
1. In the same pan, add minced garlic and grated ginger
2. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant
3. Add orange juice, zest, soy sauce, vinegar, and honey
4. Bring to a simmer
5. Stir in the cornstarch slurry (2 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water)
6. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens to coat a spoon
7. **Taste and adjust:** Should be balanced between sweet, tangy, and savory
   - Too sweet? Add more vinegar or soy sauce
   - Too sour? Add more honey
   - Too salty? Add more orange juice
   - Flat? Needs more vinegar and salt

### Combine
1. Add the cooked chicken back to the pan with the sauce
2. Toss to coat evenly
3. Keep the broccoli separate for now

## Broccoli Options

### Option 1: Air Fryer (Recommended for Crispiness)
1. Toss broccoli florets with 1-2 tablespoons oil and your chosen seasonings
2. Preheat air fryer to 375°F (190°C)
3. Air fry in batches (don't overcrowd!) for 10-12 minutes, shaking halfway through
4. Cook until edges are crispy and lightly charred

**Tips:**
- Work in 2-3 batches to avoid overcrowding
- Keep florets uniform in size for even cooking
- Store first batches in a low oven (200°F) while finishing the rest

### Option 2: Oven Roasted
1. Toss broccoli with 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and seasonings
2. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet
3. Roast at 425°F (220°C) for 18-22 minutes, flipping halfway through
4. Cook until edges are crispy and lightly charred

### Option 3: Steamed (Less Recommended)
1. Steam or blanch broccoli for just 2-3 minutes until bright green but still quite firm
2. Slightly undercook as it will soften when reheated

## Meal Prep & Storage

### Portioning
- Divide into 5 containers
- **Keep broccoli separate from saucy chicken if possible** to prevent sogginess (especially important for air fried/roasted broccoli)
- If you must combine, add broccoli at the last minute before sealing

### Storage
- Stores in refrigerator for up to 4 days
- Can be frozen for up to 2 months

### Reheating
- **Microwave:** 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through
- **For crispy broccoli:** Reheat broccoli in a hot skillet or toaster oven while microwaving the chicken separately
- **If sauce clumps:** Add a splash of water or orange juice and stir vigorously. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

### Why Chicken Thighs?
They retain moisture much better than chicken breasts when reheated, staying tender and juicy.

### Sauce Consistency
Should coat the back of a spoon but still drizzle off easily—like a thin syrup. Not watery, not gloppy.

### Cornstarch Issues When Reheating
Cornstarch-thickened sauces can clump or separate when reheated. This is normal!
- **Fix:** Add liquid and stir vigorously when reheating
- **Prevention:** Slightly under-thicken the sauce initially for meal prep
- **Alternative:** Skip cornstarch and reduce sauce naturally until syrupy (takes longer but reheats more reliably)

### Orange Variations
Oranges vary in sweetness—trust your taste buds and adjust sugar accordingly!

## Flavor Profile

When done right, the sauce should taste:
- **Sweet** (honey/sugar and orange juice)
- **Tangy/acidic** (rice vinegar and orange juice)  
- **Savory/salty** (soy sauce)

All three notes should be in harmony—none should dominate. Think sweet-and-sour but with bright citrus instead of heavy sweetness.
