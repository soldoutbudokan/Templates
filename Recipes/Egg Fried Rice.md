# Egg Fried Rice

*Serves 2 — egg-forward with crispy edges*

## Ingredients

- 2 cups cooked rice (ideally day-old and cold)
- 4 eggs
- 4 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (vegetable, canola)
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- ½ tsp MSG
- Salt and white pepper to taste

## Method

Use your largest skillet over high heat.

Heat 1 tbsp oil until just starting to smoke. Beat all 4 eggs with a pinch of salt, pour them in, and let them sit without stirring until the bottom is golden and crispy. Flip or break into pieces and cook until the edges are browned and lacy. Remove and set aside.

Add remaining oil. Toss in the white parts of the green onions, cook for 30 seconds.

Add the cold rice, breaking up any clumps. Spread it flat and let it sit for 30 seconds to get crispy, then toss. Repeat a few times.

Return the crispy eggs, add soy sauce and MSG, and toss everything together. Finish with sesame oil, white pepper, and the green parts of the onions.

## Notes

- Cold, dry rice is essential—freshly cooked rice will turn mushy
- High heat throughout; don't crowd the pan
- Let the eggs sit undisturbed to get those crispy, lacy edges
